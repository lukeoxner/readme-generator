# readme-generator

## Description

This is my seventh homework assignment for the University of Denver Web Development Boot Camp! For this project, I was to build an application which generates a nice README file based on user input. <br>

This application was built using Javascript and Node.JS. It utilizes two Node modules - Inquirer and FS. The user is asked for various details that will be included in their ReadMe, and then the custom ReadMe file is generated based on their input. <br> <br>

## Deployment

The code (and associated assets) are hosted right here in this GitHub repository. Because there isn't any kind of browser interface for this project, it's not hosted live on the web anywhere like my projects usually are. However, I did film a walk-through video that shows the functionality of the application. You can view that video here:
